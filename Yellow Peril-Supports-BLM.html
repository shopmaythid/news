            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>Where do I, as an Asian-American fit into the discussion of  Black Lives Matter? In the past, I would have kept my mouth shut and watched as other POC would fight systemic racism. Nodding along to their points, agreeing to their arguments, was how I partook in these conversations. Or so I thought-</div><div><br></div><div>For years, Asian-Americans have stood on the sidelines, never too close nor too far from the discussion of race. We’ve marched and we’ve protested, but we’ve maintained our distance, as well as our privileges.  There is a painful sentiment shared amongst the Asian community, known as internalized racism. What is internalized racism? Well, according to sociologist, Karen D. Pyke, it can be defined as the “internalization of racial oppression by the racially subordinated.” However, I do not think this definition encompasses all the manifestations of internalized racism. For each ethnic group, it presents itself in different ways; within that group, it differs from person to person. There is no universal definition of internalized racism because it is unique to each individual and their personal experiences.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As a general census, internalized racism in Asian communities appears as white-washing, colorism, anti-blackness, etc. Generation after generation is starting to lose touch with their roots and cultures, in attempts to fit into Eurocentric ideals and avoid being the target of racism. I, for example, would try to act more “white” and distance myself from my heritage. I refused to learn Chinese and Spanish, which is one of my deepest regrets. I ignored the beauty in Cantonese and Mexican culture because I was so fixated on fitting in with my Caucasian classmates. As a result, I missed out on a quinceañera, traveling to China for a summer, and being able to communicate with my grandparents. I threw all of that away because I wanted to be White.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Racism towards Asians has become normalized in our society, which only exacerbates the internalization. Countless names, the tugging at eyes, and the appropriation, not to mention the sexualization, of Asian culture. Stereotypes, like the model minority myth, have become synonymous with our identities. You’re not a quiet, goody-two-shoes, multi-talented genius? Outcast. You don’t want to pursue a career as a doctor or lawyer? Failure. These standards are not only held by Caucasians, but also by other Asians. The pressure to conform is so severe, that Asian-Americans are more likely than any other ethnic group to have suicidal ideations throughout their lives.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That being said, we, as Asian-Americans, do hold privileges that African-Americans and Latinos are not granted. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to walk around in public, without fearing for our safety. If a cop car passed by, we didn’t immediately wonder, am I next, like the way Black and Brown communities do. As much as I want to dismantle the normalization of racism against Asian-Americans, I recognize that right now, is not the time for our fight. We need to be better allies to the Black and Brown communities. We need to use our privileges to speak out and challenge white supremacy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Complacency is one of humanity's many downfalls, and it costs lives. On May 25th of this year, George Perry Floyd Jr. was murdered by a police officer, Derek Chauvin. Onsight was another officer, who turned his back and ignored Chauvin’s actions, by the name Tou Thao. Thao is a Hmong-American, who has been a police officer since 2012. In the past eight years, roughly six complaints had been filed against him. His most severe complaint was made by Lamar Ferguson, who sued Thao for using excessive force back in October of 2014. During the arrest, Ferguson claims “they started swinging [him] around and slammed [him] on the ground” (AsAmNews). He adds that Thao “was the most aggressive one” (AsAmNews). While the Minneapolis Police Department was able to settle with Ferguson for $250,000, Thao did not receive any disciplinary action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thao’s ignorance should be a wake-up call for all Asian-Americans. We can no longer sit back and watch as innocent Black and Brown people are being lynched, murdered, and terrorized. We need to step up and we, myself included, should have done it a long time ago. I recognize that I have privilege, so I’m gonna use that to amplify Black and Brown voices. I’m going to use my power to fight for their basic human rights, to fight for justice, and to fight for human lives. Enough blood has been shed to fill oceans and when it overflows, as it has, there will be uproars. We can no longer be silent and let white supremacy take away parents, children, loved ones, and friends. It’s time to take that leap forward; to have those conversations with the older generations, to challenge anti-blackness and question where we stand in this fight because as many have said, “silence is violence.”</div><div>-Genevieve Clay, Chinese-Mexican American</div></div>
