            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>May 28th, 2020, </div><div><br></div><div>I lay in my bed. I look outside my window and see the glistening skyline of downtown Oakland backed by the lights of the San Francisco Bay. At first glance, all seems beautiful and polished as usual; yet, tonight I will fall asleep to the sound of continuous sirens. I feel so sheltered sitting in my room reflecting on the bigger cities in front of me. I feel so small. Single tears turn into a storm and I begin to write in my journal, which is decorated with flowers and cartoons, once called my “Summer 2018 Journal”. My hand scribbles on the paper trying to convey all of the emotions inside of me. ‘My heart feels so heavy’. ‘So heavy’, I repeat. Suddenly, this journal turns from what was once a lighthearted compilation of my daily endeavors, to the place that holds some of my deepest and most vulnerable thoughts and feelings. I flip the page over to my previous entry written on May 12th, 2020. The entry opens up by stating ‘I feel so deeply’. That night, I watched the “Becoming” documentary about Michelle Obama, one of my greatest role models, book tour. In the documentary, I was so inspired by the brilliant young Black and Latina women that were featured, that it brought me to tears. Again, my heart felt like a boulder in my chest and I wrote ‘I want to connect with these incredible young women, yet how?’.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My name is Sadie Dodson and I am sixteen years old. I live in the affluent town of Piedmont, California, which is sheltered within the boundaries of Oakland. I attend The Head-Royce School, a prestigious private institution where Black and Latino students are few and far between. I play lacrosse, a sport that is predominantly-White. I pinch myself for this. Ever since I was young, I always felt as though people perceived me as just another “ordinary privileged White girl”. While I am still conscious of the image I may reflect, this idea has become more complex. I am constantly questioning how I can show my genuine support for the Black Lives Matter movement as a girl who has never had to experience or think about the hardships Black people in the US face every day. My parents never had to teach me how to act when pulled over by a cop. When I see the police, all I am worried about is getting a ticket for walking my dogs off-leash. I was never told not to wear a hood pulled over my head when walking down the street. All I consider is whether or not I have worn that hoodie in the past couple of days. Now, that is White privilege.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Surely, my activism will not be through a single social media post or hashtag. It must come from the heart and real energy expended educating myself and those around me. I often feel like I walk a fine line as some may think I do not have the authority or experience to talk about such issues. I believe it is this notion that has silenced and intimidated white people for so long. The ideas that it is not “our” issue to solve or “our” battle to fight are wrong.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This issue brings several layers of challenges. The first layer is the racial injustice and inequality in the US, itself. Systemic racism in the United States is an issue that is deeply rooted in the foundation of our country, and while it seems near impossible to fully solve the issue, the fight starts with every voice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second layer would be initial responses and calls to action. While seeing an influx of social media shares and calls to action are powerful, it is what occurs behind the post that makes the biggest impact; whether it be through signing petitions, donations or simply raising awareness.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This leads us to the next layer, the actions we take within our own community. One of the best ways to spread awareness is by holding a dialogue. A couple of weeks ago I wanted to reach out to a friend of mine whom I care very deeply for. While I genuinely wanted to check in on her, as I know there have been difficult things she is grappling with as a young Black woman, I was struggling to decide whether or not I should. My hesitation was not within my own motives. I was just nervous that my reaching out could seem disingenuous and forced. The challenge lies within the idea that you do not always know who is ready to hold conversations; and/or who is open to learning and educating themselves. It is time to break down the barriers that shelter us, whether it be a geographical location, the school you attend, or the extracurricular activities you engage in. Once broken, there will be open space for honest dialogue, trust, and compassion. By doing this, we create a more comfortable environment to discuss and share our opinions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly, we must be ready for our emotions and perspectives to be challenged. Every person is handling these times of uncertainty differently. I have found the importance of being patient with myself and allowing myself the time to learn, feel, think, and heal. So if it is crying it out or holding a conversation, the emotions hold power and there is strength in every voice, no matter your race, socioeconomic status, or political beliefs. As I wrote in my journal on May 12th,  “I can’t change where I am from or the school I attend, yet I will always speak up and out”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
