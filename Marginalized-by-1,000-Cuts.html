I was hesitant, however, I felt it was necessary. While all names have been masked, all details are true and accurate. While this letter was meant for my coach, it also is meant to empower those who feel silenced in their sport or community and teach those who have privilege to use it wisely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I first joined this sport because it was recommended to me by many of my friends who thought I would excel in the fast-paced, highly competitive, and well-organized environment. There was also a consistent underlying tone that this sport would be a catalyst to me being a standout applicant to top universities. While I knew the sport was predominately white, I have participated in many other majority-white sports and attend a predominately white and privileged school. The idea of being one of few African Americans was expected and rather unconcerning, but this sport was unlike the others.  Here, I felt targeted and marginalized. Throughout the season the microaggressions piled up. In the moment, I would brush off the offensive and stereotypical words of my teammates, yet by the end of the season, I was weighed down by the onslaught of tiny little cuts that I had dealt with that eventually felt like a major wound. The final blow was at our last team meeting, where I received the award of “most likely to teach someone how to give a head nod”. Keep in mind, this is in comparison to some of my peers awards which were “most likely to cure cancer” or “most likely to star in a commercial”.&nbsp;</div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>To Coach,</p><p>Even with the video explanation, the award is quite “lame” for the lack of a better term. From my point of view, the head nod is often brought up when describing interactions between black people. After the team Zoom call, my teammates explained to me the reason I received that award was because I had clarified “slang words” to you prior in the season. Being a part of the very marginal population of black people in the club I would imagine that you now understand how when putting these pieces together the award seems racially biased. Quite frankly, I would rather not receive an award than have to receive that one. However, I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that the award was just a last-minute selection.&nbsp;</p><p>I will start by saying that it is not my job to educate you on this matter and by you requesting my opinion shows me that you know that what you said was inadequate and, in all likelihood, you do not surround yourself with any people of color or anyone who has any form of education on the topic of race-related subjects. As for your opening speech in regard to the George Floyd case, it was quite poor, and I would say almost laughable. Your excuses for being “much smoother talking about sports” are simply not good enough. Whether the speech was online or in-person, if you legitimately believed in what you were saying, you would command the group’s attention. If you know that you are not a strong speaker on the fly, then you need to properly prepare to give a statement in this kind of situation, just as you would do preparing for competition day.&nbsp;</p><p>You opened up your speech strong by mentioning George Floyd’s murder head-on, but everything was downhill after that. You tried to make a personal connection to all of the recent events by mentioning how you were still learning about the topics of everything going on today, which is fair considering there are a lot of people trying to become educated with what is happening in our world and the recent turn of events have been eye-opening to people. It was every single part of the speech after this that was atrocious. To refresh your memory you talked about how you used to be homophobic and the reasoning behind that was because you were not acquainted with anyone apart of the LGBTQ+ community, and while that may be your story, by you not drilling in that those ideals are wrong it sends a message to the team that if they do not closely know anyone who is a person of color or apart of the LGBTQ+ community, then their actions against them are excusable. You continued to talk about your past after that and said that you only knew 5 black people who attended your high school, and 4 out of the 5 of those students were from the inner city and had to be bused into school because they were from another town. You see Coach, these words only further reinforce the stereotype that black people are only seen as poor and have nothing else going for them. You eluded to this stereotype a second time being when you talked about the club’s community outreach program that the city requires. You linked the community outreach program story to the story about the 5 black kids at your high school further reinforcing the idea that black people are impoverished and indirectly saying that community stewardship is unimportant in life. But have you ever taken a step back to figure out why there are little to no black people participating in the sport? The reason is not that we are all living paycheck to paycheck but because there is an extremely toxic community that you are a part of.</p><p>If you want to call yourself a true leader, you need to do better, Coach! You stated that in our meeting you would not condemn your athletes if they said the n-word because others would teach them a lesson. The use of this language was appalling for me to hear because even after knowing the events that have taken place recently and for the past 400 years, you are allowing such egregious language to be used by your athletes. Not to mention how our team is a majority white, and a majority of whom are privileged, as well; therefore, in many situations regarding race or class, they would be the oppressors. Yet, once again, like the rest of the season, you have failed to properly tackle this issue, and in your reflection to me about what you said during today’s Zoom call, you barely took any accountability. For someone who preaches accountability so much to their athletes, you do not demonstrate that in your own leadership.</p><p>Judging by the fact that you had to receive information from another teammate about athletes having ugly undercurrents in our environment, conveys that you either have a blatant disregard for inexcusable actions or you, in fact, are not the coach that you put yourself on this pedestal to be. For example, during multiple times in the season, it was either brought to my attention or heard loud and clear at practice that on our team alone, there were multiple racist group chats that involved most, if not all, of the non-black athletes either saying or writing out the n-word on a daily basis. I actually was shown these group chats by teammates saying that they “just wanted to let me know what was happening” when in actuality they were just trying to get a negative reaction out of me. These same athletes also were “allowing me the opportunity” to join these group chats on multiple occasions either because they viewed me as the token black person or thought that I would be the one to explode on the group causing nice entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>The saddest part about your speech was not the words that came out of your mouth, but rather the reminder that there are far too many people in our club’s community and in the world who have the same mindset as you. What you all have in common is falsy acting like leaders, failure to appreciate and integrate diversity into your communities, and constant neglect of issues that do not affect your daily life.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, on the topic of falsely acting like leaders, your actions are extremely disappointing because many times at practice you would talk about how you wanted to set a strong example for the team, yet you did the exact opposite. You and I both know that actions speak louder than words. I know that you are capable of sending an email in a timely manner, as you have shown that by getting on people, including myself to send out fundraising emails; yet, you waited until today to say anything. There were people in 50 states who chose to say something before you did, Coach. You can say what you want about the people on social media posting black screens in solidarity, but you cannot change the fact that by them typing out a hashtag, they wrote more than you did.&nbsp;</p><p>After reading the bulk of this message, you may still be under the impression that the athletes are just too young and naive to understand what is happening. If you still choose to believe that bogus information, you cannot deny that your assistant coaches and the rest of the organization are also complacent to both your and the athlete’s actions. In practice or in speeches to the team, you would constantly make insensitive remarks. Instead of them confronting it, they laughed with you and/or would pile on to the remarks. These actions are unacceptable because as a coach not only are you setting a poor example, but if the people surrounding you are carbon copies of you and support the same ideals as you, then who exactly is supposed to put you in check? A 15-year-old high school student who is trying to make the top lineup and climb the ranks? Because after all, you are the one who makes the lineups at the end of the day.</p><p>As a sports organization, the team you run is much more than just about the sport. For as much time and effort every athlete at the club puts in, it should feel like a family. A true family loves and accepts you for all of your flaws and differences, and while I fully understand that this is a sharp elbow and grueling sport, in this club there is a toxic community that you constantly contribute to. For you to be a 30-year-old man who constantly boasts about receiving an Ivy League education, you should be embarrassed that I even have to send you this. Clearly, in your 30+ years on this earth, you have barely even taken the time to look at issues that are outside of you and not a single Ivy League degree can increase your amount of common sense or lack of compassion for others. I can tell that it is long overdue that someone has checked your shameful actions and that if you really want to do the work to improve then you need to expand outside of the bubble that you are living in so that you can be a true leader and role model to your athletes. &nbsp;</p><p>So while this message might make you feel uncomfortable and targeted and makes you remember your university days at your Ivy League school when someone first brought up the idea of white privilege and you felt attacked, I hope that you feel that way because that is how I feel every single day of my life. If your response to this message is coming up with more sorry excuses and saying that you “have to get better at that” I ask that you respectfully keep it to yourself and read this message over again until you can comprehensively analyze it in order to find the true meaning. I encourage you to ask yourself many questions along the lines of how you help contribute to a disease called racism, how you personally benefit from racism, how many times you have turned a blind eye to racist, sexist or homophobic remarks, and how long you have put off learning about this topic when it was right in front of you the whole time? You also need to start having conversations with your friends and family in order to become educated. Since you call yourself an avid reader as well, I highly suggest that you spend this time in quarantine polishing up your knowledge on things like the Black Lives Matter movement, systematic racism, and America’s corrupt legal system.</p><p></p></div>
