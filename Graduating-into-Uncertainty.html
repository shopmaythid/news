The internet has shown us this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My friend, a fellow high school senior, told me that he was afraid to go to college next year. Assumingly, I thought he was afraid for his health because of COVID-19; that he perhaps had asthma, or another underlying health condition, but when I asked him why, he said that after seeing videos of police interaction with black bodies wearing protective masks on the internet, he was afraid to be black and wear a mask at his future school, located in the south.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Generation-Z is known for being proficient in navigating the internet. We grew up alongside the popularization of it; naturally knowing how to search, find, collect and publish images that all have a digital rhetoric. This is useful for many things, whether showing grandma how to Skype with her friends, or staying connected at a time like now, where physical distance is necessary. But on the other hand, the constant access to visuals on the internet can be damaging, especially when the visuals showcase the disposability of your own body.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The weekend of May 1st, a crowded West Village New York City park was documented online. Hundreds of young white people were seen breaking social distancing guidelines, yet were being politely handed masks by NYPD officers. It went viral. It was not just the nature of the violation of the social distance guidelines that brought so much internet attention, it was the stoic contrast in the treatment of members belonging to different racial backgrounds.</div></div>

But for black high school seniors, the access to these visuals comes at a time of intense change; growing up. There are posts that say “Congratulations to the class of 2020 for graduating high school, the world is yours!” Juxtaposed to posts showing us visually that the world is for anyone but us. Going to college, navigating the beginning stages of adulthood, and stepping out into the world are challenging tasks in ordinary times. But now, we must navigate surviving the harms of Corona, while simultaneously surviving the racialized systems actively imposed to limit our lives.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>The youth, my generation, is entering the world with access to its entirety on our fingertips. We are separated by distance due to the Coronavirus, but together in our experiences on the internet. As we age, we must do our best on social media to republish graphic images of violence on black communities with not the intention of consumption but disruption and activism; sharing posts that inform our white counterparts instead of generating apprehension in black life; starting a new trend of informing from our perspective instead of being informed by fear and the repetition of visual trauma.</p><p>For those with privilege whose masks serve as shields from germs instead of a weapon used against you, I urge you to use your social media, and the power of visual rhetoric, to dismantle the historic visual exploitation of black bodies through systemic violence with intention and care to the impacts these visuals can have on black people.&nbsp;</p><p>Anti-blackness is everywhere - not just on college campuses in the south, or murderous crime scenes of innocent black men killed by police officers - it is woven into the practices of American existence, hidden in dog parks and northern street corners. COVID-19 is exposing these practices to the everyday eye through social media.&nbsp;</p><p>In months to come, when Corona is gone and we can finally take off our masks, I hope that the mask painted onto members of my community through media structures and the internet will start to come off by refining social media experiences with blackness, too.&nbsp;</p><p></p></div>
