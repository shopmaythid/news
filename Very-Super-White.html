        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><em>I am in a new relationship with anti-racism. I have never explicitly written about my privilege, my whiteness, or my explorations of such with my family, friends, or self. I am scared to seem ignorant. I am scared to sound nauseatingly privileged. Please know: I write this from a place of compassion, fueled by a will to learn and to deconstruct and repair the perverted American system, objectives which cannot be met without failure, without being wrong, and without recognizing such failures.&nbsp;</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>&nbsp;</em>I am a Very Super White person. I was born in a WASP-y township of straight couples—broker men and trophy women—and ridiculously exorbitant real estate. We soon moved to a Very Super White state, perpetuating my Very Super White reality, where I have lived for sixteen years with a younger sister, my maternal grandmother, and parents. I grew up in a pool of white bodies dotted with two or three Black and brown bodies, a bubble in which we were taught to trust policemen and to unconditionally celebrate the Fourth of July.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Slavery? History.”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Racist? No, I would never treat a Black or brown person differently,” (despite them being scarce in my daily life).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “This Thanksgiving, I’m thankful to live in America.”</div><div>The absence of social unrest and injustice in a white-dominant dream state easily blinds. The overwhelmingly liberal pocket that is my white town has us believe we are sinless. Racism and discrimination are not immediately visible, save for in the tabloids. How could we acknowledge what goes unnoticed? We must be innocent, us Very Super Whites, our hands clean. How could we address a problem that went unseen? That the system which guarded our lives and looted others’?</div><div><br></div><div>The broadening of my intellectual world and exposure to chronicled injustice in the media sounds the alarm. My education shakes me awake as the bubble bursts. And at this moment, in June 2020, America’s problems, subsequently my problems, are Here. They demand to be seen. The murder of George Floyd in police custody is atrocious. The murder of Breonna Taylor, in her bed, in her own home is barbaric. The murder of Ahmaud Arberry is intolerable. (As I reread this at a later date, a significant number of new murders, I see, go unaccounted for: Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salau, Riah Milton, Dominique Fells, to name just three.) COVID-19’s ascendance has disproportionately devastated BIPOC communities. If our “progressive” present is sinful, what of our horrid past?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I am eighteen now. I can vote. I have a responsibility to the American people. I cannot operate on excuses, close my eyes, and continue my untouched, Very Super White life. The permitted destruction of our planet, my planet, the planet and the grave mistreatment of its people, my people, our people, sickens me. Injustice devastates and drowns. I want to cry. I want to reconcile all that is wrong, want to squeeze all the good out of my Time, want to be clean, guilt-free. But hysterics serve no purpose if they go unchanneled into action. Immediate action. The action within my circle, my control. A circle of my family and of myself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am a white body. I profit from a sinful history. My vessel wields power in a system designed to oppress. I will never be innocent, nor will my Very Super White family. I must yield my power to amplify marginalized voices, to break a system from which I have and am benefitting. To be of a white body is to be privileged. To be privileged is to enlist in a fight for justice. To be passive is to oppress.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Talking to my Very Super White family about systemic racism is a task ridden with fragility. My family is one of emergent wealth and socioeconomic privilege. We are white-bodied, but my parents’ formations have not been without hardship, however nonracial these challenges be. Their accumulation of capital is sensitive in its greenness. Discussions surrounding racial privilege strike a deep-rooted nerve.</div><div><br></div><div>I was surprised, when discussing George Floyd’s murder late Wednesday night, that my father did not characterize this brutalization of a Black body as an inherently racist act. He intellectualized the event: “We don’t know the whole story!”; “What if the cop were Black?”; “What happened in the seconds before the man was on the ground?”&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Most stunning: “You’re reacting emotionally. You must be rational!”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; My mom and I could not understand. The argument escalated. We eventually went to bed sour: my dad in a hurt huff, my mom weary of my dad’s “not being heard,” me frustrated and perplexed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My dad is a contrarian. He offered to buy me a subscription to the New York Times on the condition that I also read a libertarian publication Reason. He characterized this intake of a diversity of opinions as my “democratic duty.” Regardless of one’s “contrarian” values, racism should not be intellectualized, especially not by a white, heterosexual man.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My dad and I exchanged articles throughout the week, him dismissing Roxanne Gay’s recent NYT feature as whiny, or some of my other suggestions as “lacking empirical evidence.” By afternoon Friday, a looming discomfort had installed itself in our house. As I sat in my kitchen with my grandmother and father, privilege entered the discussion.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Hey, Grandma didn’t come from privilege.”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “I know, but she has white privilege”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “You’re offending her. She worked incredibly hard to get to where she is now. She came from nothing.”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “I’m not discounting her rigor. I’m not saying she did not work hard. She benefits from white privilege by virtue of being white, simply meaning that issues surrounding race were not an obstacle to overcome. The system never worked against her because of her race.”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “I guess.”</div><div><br></div><div>By Monday, my dad returned from work raw and dismissive. Already victimized as the only male in a household of outspoken women, he felt our conversations about race the week prior had been a ploy to villainize him.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; “I’m trying. I just don’t get it. But I’m trying.”</div><div><br></div><div>Why was my dad threatened, so defensive? Let's provide context, as to why:</div><div><br></div><div>My parents overcame hardship; yet, they live within a system that celebrates white success, their success, and blames others, POC, for their lack thereof. My parents’ difficulties never occurred as a direct consequence of their race. Their anxieties are never race-related. They do not lose time to race-related fear. And here lies the knot.</div><div><br></div><div>My dad was born in Queens to second-generation Euro-Americans and later moved to New London. His mom was a middle school science teacher, and his dad worked in investment banking. My dad disdainfully remembers watered-down canned juice and off-brand cereal. As my grandfather likes to joke, “We’ve got a lot of class. Mostly lower.” Though my dad’s childhood was not ‘cushy,’ to say the least, he was loved and supported. He hustled in high school, a three-season varsity athlete and valedictorian. His college was paid for, but his career was built of long hours of exhaustive work. The first fifty years of his life have been riddled by economic anxiety; he pursued banking to gain security. His path has been one of stark individualism; he views himself as self-made and the world as harsh and indifferent. Conclusion: life is difficult.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My mom comes from a white rural working-class family, the child of teenage welfare hippies who parented through a drug-induced haze for all of her childhood and adolescence. Homesteading in Maine, my mom survived off hard loaves of home-baked loaves and hunks of government-issued cheese cut at a slant. A stint in the Bay Area. Back to a central middle class town of 2,000 where my grandmother tirelessly waited tables to scrape by. My mom was a victim of physical and sexual abuse, losing her alcoholic biological father only to see him replaced by a cokehead stepfather. My mom cursed at a young age, played with dead kittens, and was sworn to a small group of her fellow misfit children by the warnings of well-to-do parents. Her childhood was difficult to the point that, as she escaped her roots, she developed a sharp classicism out of fear that she remember her traumatic childhood or sink once more to its depths. She put herself through college landscaping and teaching aerobics, then entered the publishing business. Overwhelming conclusion: life is difficult.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In my dad’s eyes, to acknowledge privilege is to discount struggle. To be racist is to be a villain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Five weeks since the murder of George Floyd, it's been four weeks since the establishment of an anti-racism dialogue within my family. Dissonance rises and falls. Our conversations leave egos wounded and relations rocky. I emphasize that the demonization of a person because of their current beliefs is harmful to progress. Change is possible. A body is a vessel for ideas. A vessel with its own vision skewed by its identity within society. To disturb and purge the notions which uphold the racist American institution from these vessels is a first step. To disturb is to “make uncomfortable.” To recognize the vessel’s sensitivities (white fragility), to normalize them, to break them down, is to promote progress.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To acknowledge that the being is separate from the poison that is systemic racism is crucial. I am proud of our unit for speaking in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love my family. Love is patience. Love is labor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Four weeks since my deepest, cathartic acquaintance with anti-racism,</div><div>conversations are less contentious but on-going. My dad is beginning to better sympathize with the tenets of the revolution. He no longer sulks when amongst the rest of us. My family has clarified ‘privilege’ and ‘racism.’ The taboo melts away with redefinition. These terms become non-threatening, and instead, motivating. Something to work with, something to work against. As I, as we, continue to read, to listen, to watch, to educate myself, conversation flows with greater ease. I feel our vessels opening, their contents stirring and escaping, replaced by empathy and passion.</div><div><br></div><div>Diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice are not one-offs. We* must infuse our daily actions with these values. We* must stay vigilant: to learn, to process, to act. We* must commit ourselves to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, even when the practice is uncomfortable and difficult. To begin, ask yourself:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
